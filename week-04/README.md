## Homework

The things we learned in class this week are a little less linear, so for this assignment feel free to break away from the styled text document idea we have been working with. Try making a landing page, a looping animation, or just experiment and play with everything we've learned so far.

Not all techniques will be relevant to all projects, try to use at least 2 of the things we learned this week. Plus anything else you are excited about.

- Use flex or grid in your layout
- Use a CSS gradient, or the background-image to add detail
- Use a pseudo-selector to add conditional styling to some part of your site
- Use a CSS transition to animate an element on :hover
- Add a CSS animation to your site

## Resources
- TBD
